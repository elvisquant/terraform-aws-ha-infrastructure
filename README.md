#Terraformed AWS Multi-Tier Application Platform


📖 Overview


This repository contains enterprise-grade Terraform code to define, provision, and manage a secure, highly available, and scalable multi-tier application platform on AWS. This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution embodies modern cloud best practices, incorporating reliability, security, and operational efficiency from the ground up. It serves as a foundational blueprint for deploying production workloads.
🏆 Highlights & Value Proposition

    -Production-Ready Architecture: Implements a robust multi-AZ infrastructure designed for 99.99% availability.

    -Security by Design: Embeds security controls (network segmentation, least privilege IAM, encrypted resources) into the core architecture.

    -GitOps-Driven CI/CD: A fully automated pipeline using GitHub Actions for secure and compliant infrastructure deployment.

    -Comprehensive Observability: Built-in support for AWS CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and Traces for full-stack visibility.

    -Cost-Optimized: Leverages auto-scaling, managed services, and intelligent resource provisioning to control costs.

Key Components:

    -Networking: VPC with Public, Private, and Data subnets across three Availability Zones. NAT Gateways, Internet Gateway, and VPC Endpoints for secure connectivity.

    -Web Tier: Public-facing Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

    -Application Tier: Private Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances for business logic.

    -Data Tier: Multi-AZ Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance and a Redis ElastiCache cluster for session storage.

    -Security: Dedicated Security Groups for each tier, IAM Roles with instance profiles, and AWS KMS for encryption.

    -Operations: CloudWatch Alarms, Log Groups, and an S3 bucket for centralized logs and backups.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

    -AWS Account: With appropriate permissions to create resources.

    -Terraform: v1.0+ installed locally. Download here.

    -AWS CLI: Configured with credentials. aws configure

    -Git: Version control.

Quick Deployment (Dev Environment)

    Clone the Repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/elvisquant/terraform-aws-ha-infrastructure.git
cd terraform-aws-ha-infrastructure

Initialize Terraform:
bash

cd environments/dev
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl

Review the Execution Plan:
bash

terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

Deploy the Infrastructure:
bash

    terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

    Type yes to confirm.

🔧 Configuration
Input Variables (environments/prod/terraform.tfvars)

Configure your environment by modifying the terraform.tfvars file.

project_name = "enterprise-webapp"
environment  = "prod"

# Network
vpc_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"

public_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
private_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.4.0/24", "10.0.5.0/24", "10.0.6.0/24"]

# Compute
web_instance_type   = "t3.medium"
app_instance_type   = "t3.medium"
min_size            = 2
max_size            = 6
desired_capacity    = 2

# Database
db_instance_class   = "db.t3.medium"
db_engine_version   = "14.5"
db_allocated_storage = 100
db_name             = "app_prod_db"
db_username         = "admin" # In production, use Secrets Manager

Outputs

After applying, Terraform will output critical information such as:

    alb_dns_name - The DNS name of the load balancer to access the application.

    rds_endpoint - The connection endpoint for the PostgreSQL database.

    vpc_id - The ID of the created VPC.

🔐 Security & Compliance

    -Secrets Management: Database passwords and sensitive values are injected via AWS Secrets Manager (recommended) or Terra Cloud/Vault. Never hardcode secrets.

    -Encryption: All resources (RDS, EBS volumes, S3 buckets) are encrypted at rest using AWS KMS.

    -Network Security: Security Groups are tightly scoped to allow only necessary traffic between tiers. NACLs provide a secondary layer of subnet-level security.

    -Least Privilege IAM: IAM roles attached to EC2 instances have only the permissions essential for their operation.

📊 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

This project includes a sophisticated GitOps workflow located in .github/workflows/terraform.yml.

Key Pipeline Features:

    -Terraform Plan on PR: Automatically runs terraform plan and comments on Pull Requests for review.

    -Terraform Apply on Merge: Executes terraform apply against the main branch upon successful PR merge.

    -State Management: Remote backend using S3 and DynamoDB for state locking.

    -Security: Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate with AWS, eliminating the need for long-lived static credentials.

    -Quality Gates: Includes steps for terraform validate and terraform fmt -check.

🛠️ Operations & Maintenance
Monitoring

    Dashboards: Pre-built CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring CPU utilization, database connections, ALB request counts, and error rates.

    Alarms: Key alarms for auto-scaling events, CPU credit balance, and RDS free storage space.

Scaling

The infrastructure scales horizontally based on CloudWatch alarms (e.g., high CPU utilization). Adjust the scaling policy in the compute module to meet specific performance requirements.
Cost Management

    Use AWS Cost Explorer with tags (Project, Environment) to track spending.

    Consider Graviton-based instances (e.g., t4g.medium) for potential cost savings and performance improvements.

    Implement AWS Budgets to alert on cost overruns.

Disaster Recovery

The multi-AZ design provides high availability. For a full region failure, a DR runbook should be established to re-deploy this infrastructure to a secondary region using the same Terraform code.
🧪 Testing

    Static Analysis: Use terraform validate and tflint to catch syntax errors and enforce best practices.

    Plan Review: The CI/CD pipeline provides a mandatory plan review step.

    Conformance Testing: (Recommended) Integrate tools like terratest to validate module functionality by deploying into a temporary environment and running assertions.
